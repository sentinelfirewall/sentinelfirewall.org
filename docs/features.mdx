The reason that *Way to the Web* (original ConfigServer authors) have developed this suite is that they have found over the years of providing server services that many of the tools available for the task are either over-complex, not user friendly, or simply aren’t as effective as they could be.

## ConfigServer Firewall (csf)
CSF is an SPI iptables firewall that is comprehensive, straight-forward, easy and flexible to configure

## Login Failure Daemon (lfd)
To complement the ConfigServer Firewall (csf), a Login Failure Daemon (lfd) process runs all the time and periodically (every X seconds) scans the latest log file entries for login attempts against your server that continually fail within a short period of time. Such attempts are often called “Brute-force attacks” and the daemon process responds very quickly to such patterns and blocks offending IP’s quickly. Other similar products run every x minutes via cron and as such often miss break-in attempts until after they’ve finished, our daemon eliminates such long waits and makes it much more effective at performing its task.

Login tracking is an extension of lfd, it keeps track of POP3 and IMAP logins and limits them to X connections per hour per account per IP address.

## Control Panel Configuration Interface
To help with the ease and flexibility of the suite, a front-end to both csf and lfd is available, accessible by the root account through cPanel, DirectAdmin, OpenPanel and Webmin. From there you can modify the configuration files and stop, start and restart the applications and check their status. This makes configuring and managing the firewall very simple indeed.
