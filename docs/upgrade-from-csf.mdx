# Upgrade

Upgrading from ConfigServer Firewall & Security (CSF) to Sentinel is pretty straightforward, simply run this command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sentinelfirewall/sentinel/refs/heads/main/public/upgrade.sh)
```

<summary>What's in that upgrade script?</summary>

It is always a good idea to inspect scripts before running them!

Here is the contents of `upgrade.sh` for your verification:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# upgrade from CSF to Sentinel
# https://sentinelfirewall.org/docs/upgrade-from-csf/

wget -O /etc/csf/csf.pl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stefanpejcic/e2648c6d02c1468865e3133e1a0adab5/raw/bad53f53fc172f1ecc3d421f628c516cfe821e72/upgrade.csf.pl

csf -uf

wget -O /etc/csf/csf.pl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sentinelfirewall/sentinel/refs/heads/main/csf/csf.pl

if [ -e "/usr/local/cpanel/version" ]; then
  # https://github.com/sentinelfirewall/sentinel/issues/9
  mv /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/Config/ConfigObj/Driver/ConfigServercsf/META.pm /usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/Config/ConfigObj/Driver/ConfigServercsf/META
fi
```


</details>

Verify that upgrading from `csf` to `sentinel` succeded with:

```bash
csf -v
```

Last released version of CSF is 15.00, so if upgrade to Sentinel completed successfully, you will see at least version `15.11`.
