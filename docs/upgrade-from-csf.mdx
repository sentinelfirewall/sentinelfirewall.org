# Upgrade

Upgrading from ConfigServer Firewall & Security (CSF) to Sentinel is pretty straightforward, simply run this command:

```bash
wget -O /etc/csf/csf.pl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/stefanpejcic/e2648c6d02c1468865e3133e1a0adab5/raw/bad53f53fc172f1ecc3d421f628c516cfe821e72/upgrade.csf.pl && \
  csf -uf && \
  wget -O /etc/csf/csf.pl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sentinelfirewall/sentinel/refs/heads/main/csf/csf.pl
```

It is always a good idea to inspect scripts before running them!

Here are the links to the contents of `csf.pl` for your verification:

</details>

Verify that upgrading from `csf` to `sentinel` succeded with:

```bash
csf -v
```

Last released version of CSF is 15.00, so if upgrade to Sentinel completed successfully, you will see at least version `15.11`.
