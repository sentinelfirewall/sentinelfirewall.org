# Integrated User Interface Feature

Integrated User Interface. This feature provides a HTML UI to the features of csf and lfd, without requiring a control panel or web server. The UI runs as a sub process to the lfd daemon.

As it runs under the root account and successful login provides root access to the server, great care should be taken when configuring and using this feature. There are additional restrictions to enhance secure access to the UI:

1. An SSL connection is required
2. Separate ban and allow files are provided to only allow access to listed IP addresses
3. Local IP addresses cannot connect to the UI (i.e. all IP addresses configured on the server NICs)
4. Unique sessions, session timeouts, session cookies and browser headers are used to identify and restrict active sessions

Requirements:

1. `openssl`
2. Perl modules: `Net::SSLeay`, `IO::Socket::SSL` and dependent modules
4. SSL keys
5. Entries in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.allow`

The SSL server uses the following files:

- SSL Key goes into `/etc/csf/ui/server.key`
- SSL Certificate goes into `/etc/csf/ui/server.crt`

Preferably, real **CA signed certificates** should be used. You can use an existing domain and cert for accessing the UI by populating the two files mentioned. If the cert has a ca bundle, it should be appended to the `server.crt` file. lfd must be restarted after making any changes: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#realcert](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#realcert)

Alternatively, you could generate your own self-signed certificate: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert)

Any keys used must have their pass-phrase removed: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#removepassphrase](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#removepassphrase)

The login URL should use the domain you have listed in the self-signed cert: `https://<yourdomain>:<port>`

For example: `https://www.somedomain.com:6666`

Your browser must accept session cookies to gain access.

`UI_ALLOW` is enabled by default, so IP addresses (or CIDRs) allowed to use this UI must be listed in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.allow` before trying to connect to the UI.

Only IP addresses can be listed/used in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.ban` - this file should only be used by the UI to prevent login. Use csf blocks to prevent access to the configured port and only use [Advanced Allow/Deny Filters](/docs/usage/allow-deny-filters/) for access, i.e. do not list the port in `TCP_IN`.

Logging for UI events are logged to the lfd `/var/log/lfd.log` file. Check this file if you are unable to access the UI.

Required Perl Modules:

- On Debian v6 the perl modules can be installed using:

    ```bash
    apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl libcrypt-ssleay-perl \
                    libnet-libidn-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl libsocket6-perl
    ```

- On CentOS v6 the perl modules can be installed using:

    ```bash
    yum install perl-IO-Socket-SSL.noarch perl-Net-SSLeay perl-Net-LibIDN \
                perl-IO-Socket-INET6 perl-Socket6
    ```
