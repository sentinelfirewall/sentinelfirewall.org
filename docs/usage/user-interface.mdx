# Integrated User Interface Feature

Integrated User Interface. This feature provides a HTML UI to the features of csf and lfd, without requiring a control panel or web server. The UI runs as a sub process to the lfd daemon.

As it runs under the root account and successful login provides root access to the server, great care should be taken when configuring and using this feature. There are additional restrictions to enhance secure access to the UI:

1. An SSL connection is required
2. Separate ban and allow files are provided to only allow access to listed IP addresses
3. Local IP addresses cannot connect to the UI (i.e. all IP addresses configured on the server NICs)
4. Unique sessions, session timeouts, session cookies and browser headers are used to identify and restrict active sessions

Requirements:

1. `openssl`
2. Perl modules: `Net::SSLeay`, `IO::Socket::SSL` and dependent modules
4. SSL keys
5. Entries in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.allow`

The SSL server uses the following files:

- SSL Key goes into `/etc/csf/ui/server.key`
- SSL Certificate goes into `/etc/csf/ui/server.crt`

Preferably, real **CA signed certificates** should be used. You can use an existing domain and cert for accessing the UI by populating the two files mentioned. If the cert has a ca bundle, it should be appended to the `server.crt` file. lfd must be restarted after making any changes: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#realcert](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#realcert)

Alternatively, you could generate your own self-signed certificate: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#selfcert)

Any keys used must have their pass-phrase removed: [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#removepassphrase](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/ssl/ssl_faq.html#removepassphrase)

The login URL should use the domain you have listed in the self-signed cert: `https://<yourdomain>:<port>`

For example: `https://www.somedomain.com:6666`

Your browser must accept session cookies to gain access.

`UI_ALLOW` is enabled by default, so IP addresses (or CIDRs) allowed to use this UI must be listed in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.allow` before trying to connect to the UI.

Only IP addresses can be listed/used in `/etc/csf/ui/ui.ban` - this file should only be used by the UI to prevent login. Use csf blocks to prevent access to the configured port and only use [Advanced Allow/Deny Filters](/docs/usage/allow-deny-filters/) for access, i.e. do not list the port in `TCP_IN`.

Logging for UI events are logged to the lfd `/var/log/lfd.log` file. Check this file if you are unable to access the UI.

Required Perl Modules:

- On Debian v6 the perl modules can be installed using:

    ```bash
    apt-get install libio-socket-ssl-perl libcrypt-ssleay-perl \
                    libnet-libidn-perl libio-socket-inet6-perl libsocket6-perl
    ```

- On CentOS v6 the perl modules can be installed using:

    ```bash
    yum install perl-IO-Socket-SSL.noarch perl-Net-SSLeay perl-Net-LibIDN \
                perl-IO-Socket-INET6 perl-Socket6
    ```

## UI Skinning

The csf UI provided through cPanel, OpenPanel, DirectAdmin, Webmin and the integrated UI via lfd, all user the Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks. Additional styling is added to complement the frameworks and the UI flow.

If you want to make changes to the styling or add jQuery or JavaScript code you can create:

1. A text file `/etc/csf/csf.header` which will be included in each of the UI pages before the closing `</head>` tag
2. A text file `/etc/csf/csf.body` which will be included in each of the UI pages after the opening `<body>` tag[`*`]
3. A text file `/etc/csf/csf.footer` which will be included in each of the UIpages before the closing `</body>` tag 

The html tag will also have a data-post field containing the internal action being performed by the UI.

You can also make additions to the `<html>` and `<body>` tags by creating `/etc/csf/csf.htmltag` and `/etc/csf/csf.bodytag` respectively[`*`]. Additions made in these files **MUST** all be on a single line at the top of the file, anything else will be ignored. The text will then be placed within the respective tag, e.g. if you want `<body data-name='result'>` you would put the following on a single line in `/etc/csf/csf.bodytag`:
`data-name='result'`

[`*`] This functionality is ONLY available on webmin servers

## Mobile View

The Mobile View feature has a breakpoint of 600px which will initiate the full browser subset of UI features. This may mean breaking out of framesets in some control panels, so a return to the main control panel window is included. Also switching back to the Desktop view will remain in the full browser display.

If you switch to the Mobile View and then switch to main control panel window further accesses to the UI will always default to the Mobile View. If you switch back after returning to the Desktop View, subsequent access will default to that view. This reverts back to the default breakpoint behaviour in new browser sessions as the system uses session cookies to keep track of the chosen view which are reset one browser shutdown.

There are options in `csf.conf` that control the behaviour of these options under `STYLE_*`. Any styling changes MUST respect these options.

> **Note**: We do NOT recommend reformatting the UI output as any changes in the core code may not be reflected in the user experience and can break the product. Only style changes should be made.
