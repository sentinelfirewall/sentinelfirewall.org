:::info
Uninstalling Sentinel Firewall does **not** clean up your existing iptables. These rulles will still exist in iptables until server is restarted or iptables rules manually removed.
:::


The uninstaller will **not** remove any [dependencies](/docs/requirements/#dependencies) such as `perl`, `ipset`, or `gd-library`. You must uninstall these manually.
